## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
my_nums <-(1:6)
powers <- my_nums^2
powerData <- tibble(my_nums,powers)
powerData
```
```{r}
powerData2<- data.frame(my_nums, powers)
powerData2
```
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=powerData)
```


```{r}
p <- p + geom_point(aes(x = my_nums, y=powers))
p
```

```{r}
p<- p + labs(title = "Numbers against their powers")
p
```
```{r}
p<- p + labs(x = "Number", y = "Powers of Number")
p
```

```{r}
p <- p + labs(subtitle = "Simple Scatterplot")
p
```
